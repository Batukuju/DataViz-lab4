# Music hits analyzer

## Hit your music taste by analyzing the latest hits!

Many aspiring artists wonder what will be the public's reaction to their first creations, and how to succeed in the music business. Is it worthwhile to go into classical music and continue playing the clarinet, or is it better to convince your parents that you'd like to become a drummer after all, to feel that rhythm and bounce, or maybe invest in good vocals. 

Our dashbouard shows the main trends based on more than 3000 tracks from the last 20 years. It checks and compares how your latest song might place in a particular music category, and will help you tweak it for the better.

Plus, even if you've diverged from the artist's calling but are still curious to see how the world would rank your musical taste, you can still use this dashboard.

Tasks solved using the dashboard
1. No idea how to develop your music career.
2. Convincing parents to change their musical after-school activities.
3. Biased judgment of current trends.
